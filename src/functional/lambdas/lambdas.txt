A lambda expression represents an anonymous method,
a shorthand notation for implementing a functional interface,
similar to anonymous class.

The type of lambda expression is the type of functional interface that the lambda expression implements.
Lambda expressions can be used anywhere functional interfaces are expected.

Lambda Syntax

A lambda consists of a parameter list followed by the arrow token and a body:
    (parameterList) -> {statements}

The following lambda receives two ints and return their sum
    (int x, int y) -> {return x + y;}

When a body contains only one expression, the return keyword and curly braces may be omitted:
    (int x, int y) -> x + y;

When a parameter list contains only one parameter, the parentheses may be omitted:
    datatype value -> System.out.println(value);

To define a lambda with an empty parameter list, specify the parameter list as empty parentheses to the left of the arrow token(->):
    () -> System.out.println("Welcome to Lambdas");

There are also specialized shorthand forms of lambdas that are known as method references.
